> **For Engineering Leaders**: Stop losing weeks to environment setup, secret management, and onboarding friction. Initiat transforms your developer experience from days of setup to minutes of productivity.

## The Problem: Developer Experience Debt

**Every engineering team faces the same productivity killers:**

- **Onboarding Hell**: New developers spend days (sometimes weeks) setting up environments
- **Secret Sprawl**: API keys scattered across Slack, emails, and sticky notes
- **Environment Drift**: "Works on my machine" becomes "works on my machine, sometimes"
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical setup knowledge trapped in senior developers' heads
- **Security Gaps**: Secrets shared via insecure channels, no audit trails

**The Cost**: Lost productivity, frustrated developers, delayed releases, and security vulnerabilities.

## The Solution: Unified Developer Experience

**Initiat is building a unified developer experience platform:**

### **Zero-Knowledge Secret Management** (Available Now)
- Client-side encryption with Ed25519/X25519 cryptography
- Team-based access control with device approval workflows
- Audit trails for security and compliance
- Zero-knowledge architecture - server cannot decrypt secrets

### **Automated Environment Setup** (Planned)
- One-command project setup (`initiat setup my-project`)
- Automated dependency installation
- Environment validation to prevent drift
- Docker and containerization support

### **Guided Onboarding Workflows** (Planned)
- Interactive setup guides for new team members
- Progress tracking and completion verification
- Custom templates per project and role
- Knowledge capture from experienced developers

### **Integration Ecosystem** (Planned)
- GitHub/GitLab repository integration
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Kubernetes and cloud platform setup
- Popular development tools integration

### **Team Visibility & Analytics** (Planned)
- Onboarding dashboards showing progress and bottlenecks
- Time-to-productivity metrics
- Usage analytics and optimization insights
- Compliance reporting for security and audit

## Current Capabilities

### **Secret Management** (Production Ready - Invite only)
- Zero-knowledge secret sharing with client-side encryption
- Team-based access control with device approval workflows
- Audit trails for security and compliance
- Cross-platform CLI with macOS, Linux, and Windows support

### **Team Management** (Production Ready - Invite only)
- Device registration and approval workflows
- Workspace-based organization
- Role-based access control
- Secure key storage using OS keychain integration

## Technical Implementation

### **Cryptographic Security**
- Ed25519 signatures for device authentication
- X25519 key exchange for workspace key wrapping
- XSalsa20Poly1305 for secret value encryption
- ChaCha20Poly1305 for workspace key encryption
- HKDF-SHA256 for key derivation

### **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
- Client-side encryption before transmission
- Server cannot decrypt secrets or workspace keys
- Private keys stored in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- Forward secrecy - compromising one device doesn't affect others

### **Command Examples**
```bash
# Secret management
initiat secret set API_KEY --value "sk-1234567890abcdef" --workspace-path acme-corp/production
initiat secret get API_KEY --workspace-path acme-corp/production
initiat secret list --workspace-path acme-corp/production

# Device management
initiat device register "my-laptop"
initiat device approvals
initiat device approve --all

# Workspace management
initiat workspace list
initiat workspace init acme-corp/production
```
