## The Problem: Developer Experience Debt

**Every engineering team faces the same productivity killers:**

- **Onboarding Hell**: New developers spend days (sometimes weeks) setting up environments
- **Secret Sprawl**: API keys scattered across Slack, emails, and sticky notes
- **Environment Drift**: "Works on my machine" becomes "works on my machine, sometimes"
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical setup knowledge trapped in senior developers' heads
- **Security Gaps**: Secrets shared via insecure channels, no audit trails

**The Cost**: Lost productivity, frustrated developers, delayed releases, and security vulnerabilities.

## What's Available Now

**Zero-Knowledge Secret Management** üîê *Production ready - Invite only*

Transform how your team handles secrets with enterprise-grade security. Our zero-knowledge architecture ensures that even we can't decrypt your secrets - everything is encrypted client-side before transmission.

```bash
# Set a secret for your team (with workspace selection)
initiat secret set API_KEY --value "sk-1234567890abcdef"
# CLI will prompt: Select workspace (0 for custom): 1

# Get a secret (decrypted client-side)
initiat secret get API_KEY
# CLI will prompt: Select workspace (0 for custom): 1

# List all secrets in a workspace
initiat secret list
# CLI will prompt: Select workspace (0 for custom): 1

# Or specify workspace explicitly
initiat secret set API_KEY --value "sk-1234567890abcdef" --workspace-path acme-corp/production
```

- **Client-side encryption** with Ed25519/X25519 cryptography
- **Team-based access control** with device approval workflows
- **Audit trails** for security and compliance
- **Cross-platform CLI** for macOS, Linux, and Windows

**Team Management** üë• *Production ready - Invite only*

Streamline device and workspace management with granular control over who can access what. Every device must be approved, and every workspace can be configured with specific permissions.

```bash
# Register a new device
initiat device register "my-laptop"

# Check pending device approvals
initiat device approvals

# Approve all pending devices
initiat device approve --all

# List available workspaces
initiat workspace list

# Initialize a new workspace
initiat workspace init acme-corp/production
```

- **Device registration** and approval workflows
- **Workspace-based organization** for teams and projects
- **Role-based access control** with granular permissions
- **Secure key storage** using OS keychain integration

**Interactive Workspace Selection**

Never remember workspace names again. When you don't specify a workspace, the CLI intelligently prompts you to select from available workspaces.

```bash
# No workspace specified - CLI will show interactive selection
initiat secret list

# Output:
# ‚ùì Workspace context is required for this command.
# üí° You can specify workspace using:
#    --workspace-path org/workspace
#    --org org --workspace workspace
#    Or configure defaults with 'initiat config set org <org>' and 'initiat config set workspace <workspace>'
#
# Available workspaces:
#   1. Production Environment (acme-corp/production)
#   2. Staging Environment (acme-corp/staging)
#   3. Development Environment (acme-corp/dev)
#   0. Enter custom workspace
#
# Select workspace (0 for custom): 
```

**Benefits:**
- **Faster Workflow**: No need to remember exact workspace names
- **Discovery**: See all available workspaces at a glance
- **Flexible**: Can still enter custom workspaces when needed
- **User-Friendly**: Clear guidance and helpful error messages

## What's Coming Next

**Automated Environment Setup** üöÄ *Planned for 2026*

One command to rule them all. No more "works on my machine" - we'll automate the entire development environment setup process.

```bash
initiat setup my-project  # Sets up entire development environment
```

- Automated dependency installation
- Environment validation to prevent drift
- Docker and containerization support
- Custom templates per project and role

**Guided Onboarding Workflows** üìö *Planned for 2026*

Interactive guides that actually work. Capture knowledge from your senior developers and turn it into step-by-step onboarding workflows.

- Step-by-step setup guides for new team members
- Progress tracking and completion verification
- Knowledge capture from experienced developers
- Custom templates per project and role

**Integration Ecosystem** üîó *Planned for 2026*

Connect everything together. We're building integrations with the tools you already use to create a seamless developer experience.

- GitHub/GitLab repository integration
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Kubernetes and cloud platform setup
- Popular development tools integration

**Team Visibility & Analytics** üìä *Planned for 2026*

Data-driven developer experience. Understand where your team is spending time and identify bottlenecks in your development process.

- Onboarding dashboards showing progress and bottlenecks
- Time-to-productivity metrics
- Usage analytics and optimization insights
- Compliance reporting for security and audit

## Technical Foundation

**Cryptographic Security**

We use industry-standard cryptographic primitives to ensure your secrets are protected at the highest level. Every operation is designed with security-first principles.

- **Ed25519 signatures** for device authentication
- **X25519 key exchange** for workspace key wrapping
- **XSalsa20Poly1305** for secret value encryption
- **ChaCha20Poly1305** for workspace key encryption
- **HKDF-SHA256** for key derivation

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**

Our zero-knowledge architecture means we can't see your secrets, even if we wanted to. Everything is encrypted client-side before it ever reaches our servers.

- Client-side encryption before transmission
- Server cannot decrypt secrets or workspace keys
- Private keys stored in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- Forward secrecy - compromising one device doesn't affect others

## Quick Start

**Secret Management**

Manage your team's secrets with enterprise-grade security. Every secret is encrypted client-side before transmission.

```bash
# Set a secret
initiat secret set API_KEY --value "sk-1234567890abcdef" --workspace-path acme-corp/production

# Get a secret
initiat secret get API_KEY --workspace-path acme-corp/production

# List all secrets
initiat secret list --workspace-path acme-corp/production
```

**Device Management**

Control access with device approval workflows. Every device must be registered and approved before it can access secrets.

```bash
# Register your device
initiat device register "my-laptop"

# Check pending approvals
initiat device approvals

# Approve all pending devices
initiat device approve --all
```

**Workspace Management**

Organize your secrets by team and project. Each workspace can have its own access controls and permissions.

```bash
# List available workspaces
initiat workspace list

# Initialize a new workspace (with interactive selection)
initiat workspace init
# CLI will prompt: Select workspace (0 for custom): 1

# Or specify workspace explicitly
initiat workspace init acme-corp/production
```
