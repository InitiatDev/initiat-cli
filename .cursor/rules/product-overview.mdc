# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name (working):** *Initiat* (or chosen brand)
**Version:** Draft v2

---

## 1. Vision & Goal

Developers lose precious time during onboarding: setting up environments, configuring access, managing secrets, and piecing together scattered instructions. This slows productivity, creates security risks, and frustrates new hires.

**Initiat** is a developer-first onboarding platform designed to remove that friction. Starting with secure secret sharing as the foundation, it evolves into a complete workflow for onboarding and enabling developers. The goal is to reduce *time-to-first-commit* from days to minutes, while ensuring teams onboard securely, consistently, and with a great developer experience.

---

## 2. Objectives

* Provide immediate value through secure, simple secret sharing.
* Expand into full onboarding workflows that accelerate developer ramp-up.
* Offer developer-native interfaces (CLI, API, web UI) with polished DX.
* Keep pricing developer-friendly while preventing abuse (e.g., seat rotations).
* Build trust through security, transparency, and strong documentation.

---

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Secret Sharing & Access (MVP) - 'KeySync'

* Secure vault for API keys, tokens, environment variables.
* CLI/API commands (`Initiat secrets add/fetch`).
* Export to `.env` files and integrate with GitHub Actions, Docker, etc.
* Free tier for small teams (limited seats/workspace).
* Guardrails: seats are non-rotatable.

### 3.2 Developer Onboarding Flows (Phase 2)

* Prebuilt workspace templates for popular stacks (Node, Elixir, Python, etc.).
* One-command setup (`Initiat setup myapp`).
* Guided runbooks embedded into the flow (self-service onboarding).
* Extendable for team-specific onboarding.

### 3.3 Access & Permissions

* Role-based access controls (RBAC).
* Team invites with controlled permissions.
* Basic audit logging.

### 3.4 Collaboration & Team Dashboard

* Dashboard showing team onboarding progress.
* Access visibility (who has which secrets).
* Usage analytics (time saved, flows completed).

### 3.5 Enterprise Expansion (Future)

* SSO / SAML, SCIM provisioning.
* Advanced audit logs, compliance exports.
* Dedicated support & SLAs.
* Marketplace for onboarding templates.

---

* Free tier limits enforced.
* Paid tiers priced per member/month for fairness.

---

## 5. Target Audience

* **Primary:** Developers and DevOps engineers who onboard frequently or manage secrets.
* **Secondary:** Engineering managers responsible for productivity and compliance.
* **Initial ICP:** Small startup teams (3‚Äì10 devs) who feel onboarding pain most acutely.

---

## 6. Success Metrics

* **Time to First Commit (TTFC):** Average reduction compared to baseline.
* **Activation Rate:** % of invited devs who complete onboarding.
* **Secret Usage:** Frequency of CLI/API secret fetches.
* **Retention:** Teams active at 30/90 days.

---

## 7. Roadmap

### üöÄ MVP ‚Äî Secret Sharing (Foundation)

* Secure vault (CLI/API)
* `.env` export & CI/CD integration
* Free tier signup, seat-locking
* Docs + landing page

**Outcome:** Build trust, attract early users.

---

### ‚ö° v1 ‚Äî Onboarding Flows (First Paid Unlock)

* Workspace templates for popular stacks
* One-command project setup
* Basic runbooks & guides
* Team invites & permissions

**Outcome:** Transition from ‚Äúsecret tool‚Äù ‚Üí **onboarding accelerator**.

---

### üõ† v2 ‚Äî Collaboration & Controls

* Role-based access (RBAC)
* Workflow integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Docker, K8s)

### üè¢ v3 ‚Äî Enterprise DX Hub

* SSO / SAML, SCIM
* Compliance reporting & exports

**Outcome:** Evolution into a **developer experience platform**.

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

* **Overlap with ‚Äúvault‚Äù competitors:** Differentiate via DX + onboarding workflows.
* **Free tier abuse:** Seat-locking and workspace limits.
* **Branding confusion (locker.io, Runway, etc.):** Lean into DX-first positioning with a distinct name (e.g., *Initiat*).
* **Trust concerns:** Publish security details, open docs, audits.

---

‚ú® In this framing, **secret sharing is the hook** ‚Äî but the **story** is developer onboarding and workflow acceleration.
